# Importing SNB CSVs into Neo4j

This guide explains how to import **LDBC SNB CSV** data into **Neo4j**.



# 1. Download the data

1. Go to:  
   [https://ldbcouncil.org/data-sets-surf-repository/snb-interactive-v1-datagen-v100](https://ldbcouncil.org/data-sets-surf-repository/snb-interactive-v1-datagen-v100)

2. Download the file:  
   `social_network-sfX-CsvBasic-LongDateFormatter.tar.zst`  
   *(X = 0.1 | 0.3 | 1)*

3. Extract the archive. You will find two folders:

## static/
Contains **static entities** (data that does not change) such as:  
Tag, Place, Organisation, etc.

## dynamic/
Contains **dynamic entities and relationships** (graph events), such as:  
- knows (friendship relations)  
- messages  
- comments  
- hasCreator, replyOf, etc.

# NOTES

- All the steps below can be automated by running:  
  `automated_import_fromSNB_to_Neo4j.ps1`
- Make sure to read the **IMPORTANT** section before running the script.

---

# 4. Prepare CSV files

1. Select **only CSV files** from both `static/` and `dynamic/` folders.

2. Prepare Neo4j:  
   - Create a new database  
   - Place all CSV files into the `import/` folder of your Neo4j database

---

# 5. Create constraints / indexes (mandatory before import)

Example:


CREATE CONSTRAINT person_id IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (p:Person)
REQUIRE p.id IS UNIQUE;

# 6. Import nodes
# 7. Import relationships

# Important Notes before running the script

Before executing the automation script:

1. Install the APOC plugin in your Neo4j DBMS.

2. In the static/ and dynamic/ folders, rename the first two columns in these files:

person_knows_person.csv

comment_replyOf_comment.csv

place_isPartOf_place.csv

tagclass_isSubclassOf_tagclass.csv

The first column must be LabelName1.id and the second column must be LabelName2.id.
